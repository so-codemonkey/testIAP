# testIAP
Chrome extension to test in-app-purchases

To use this, you'll need to:
 1 - create a 128x128 icon file, name it icon_128.png, and add it to these files
 2 - zip all the test code folder
 3 - on your Chrome developer dashboard, create a new product
 4 - upload the zip file to the product's edit page
 5 - set up a sku in your product's in-app purchases tab, and name it sku1.
 6 - add a 440x220 png and use it as the product's promotional tile
 7 - publish the extension to your testers. Theoretically testers don't actually get their CCs charged
 when they test IAP.
